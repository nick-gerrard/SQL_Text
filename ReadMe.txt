Welcome to the SQL script text processor! This is a basic script which will (eventually) become a command line tool to help aid in modifying SQL scripts quickly and eficient. Sometimes, MS SQL servers will generate scripts for databases with a few lines of extraneous data scattered through it. Using this tool, one can quickly iterate through that scrit, and find and remove every extraneous line.
